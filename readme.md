# CCA Libraries Drupal Theme

Drupal (6) theme from the CCA Libraries site. It's a Zen subtheme. It needs a lot work.

## Syncing with dev/live site

The commands `npm run push-dev` and `npm run push-live` will sync the theme files to the Libraries' development and live servers, respectively. They require SSH aliases for each server set as `dev1` and `live`.
